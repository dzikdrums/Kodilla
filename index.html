     <h1>Justin Bieber</h1>
     <h2>Love Yourself</h2>
		 <h3>Himself</h3>
		 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyEuk8j8imI">Youtube link to song</a>
		 <p>For all the times that you rain on my parade<br>
			 	And all the clubs you get in using my name<br>
				You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake<br>
				You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't<br><br>

				And I didn't wanna write a song 'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care<br>
				I don't but, you still hit my phone up<br>
				And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'<br>
				I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that<br>
				My mama don't like you and she likes everyone<br>
				And I never like to admit that I was wrong<br>
				And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on<br>
				And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own<br><br>

				'Cause if you like the way you look that much<br>
				Oh baby you should go and love yourself<br>
				And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'<br>
				You should go and love yourself
			</p>
